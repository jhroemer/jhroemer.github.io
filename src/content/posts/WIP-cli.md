- Always good to do dog feeding
- https://clig.dev/
- make it intuitive to learn and use
- on interactive CLI's
- instead of view-specific hotkeys, think in reusable patterns
- a for add, s for submit, d for delete, back/forward/enter, c for 'commit'? Reorder?
- consider just a single section: ux for interactive CLI's; either: 1. show hotkeys directly in UI 2 (open code, terminal shop). `/` section that displays available commands (like claude code) 3. reusable pattern, like I went with (+ small help section) - similar to tig. Tig doesn't display the hotkey to help though, and the section is huge (2 pages at least on a mac 13")
- Most general UX principles still hold true; add friction on delete project for example (type project name)
- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_philosophy "expect the output of every program to become the input to another, as yet unknown, program."
- Navigation? Router? Stack-based approach?
