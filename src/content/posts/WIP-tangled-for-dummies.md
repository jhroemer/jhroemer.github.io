# Nix
- Dockerize (thanks Will)

# Redis
- ..

# SH
- Tangled requires push over SSH instead of HTTPS

# Go templates

- Fundamentally different to work with html
- Views are explicitly returned from server-side function calls. You provide the function call with an object and a template. The object properties are then accessible in the template.

# HTMX

- Provides the interactivity aspect, instead of only having full page refresh updates
- Lots of good articles, from a provocative but smart gui (Carson Gross)
- HTMX 4 coming up?
