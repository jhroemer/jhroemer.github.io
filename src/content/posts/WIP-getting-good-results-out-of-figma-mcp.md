Tools:

```jsx
// Example return from get_design_context
const Button = () => {
    return (
    <button>hey</button>
    )
}
// + comments to agent
```

Design context quite bloated, feels very redundant/lossy for large pieces of work
Get metadata more useful, but is needs augmenting. 

- combine with the ralph wiggum technique
- data, results, precision, errors?
