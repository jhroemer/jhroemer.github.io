Lots of people areasking themselves these days if they should stop coding by hand more or less entirely. More are probably asking themselves what they should generate, and what they shouldn't. I'm in the second category.

For context, I largely agree with Antirez' recent (and excellent) [blog post](https://antirez.com/news/158) the matter.

Now for the second category, how do you actually decide? Now I'll explain the title of this post, which should make very little sense to you unless you're danish. "Rugbrød" means rye-bread, and "arbejde" means work. The term is about boring routine-work essentially. And if you're in doubt whether to code-gen/automate something then I've found it to be a useful heruristic. "Is it rugbrødsarbejde?" if yes, then go ahead and generate it. You should be in a good position to review and assess it, and use the time-saving on something more important. Is it not? Well, then you probably benefit from getting your hands dirty. And at some point, that kind of work might just end up being rugbrødsarbejde.

- TODO: add something about simplicity

There's a lot to be said about using agents for experimental work. Throwing them at bugs, or iterating on something challenging that you don't find the time to.
