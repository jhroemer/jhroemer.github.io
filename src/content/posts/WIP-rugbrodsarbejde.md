Lots of people are asking themselves these days if they should stop coding by hand more or less entirely. More are probably asking themselves when they should lean in, and when they shouldn't. I'm in the second category.

For context, I largely agree with Antirez' recent (and excellent) [blog post](https://antirez.com/news/158) on the matter.
I also believe that good software engineering practice, like thoughtful test coverage, is more important than ever.
And I don't really vibe code personally, in the sense that if I generate code I will probably read all of it.

But all of that is a post for another day.

# When to lean in?

How do you actually decide when to lean in and generate larger chunks of code?

First let me explain the title of this post, which should make very little sense to you unless you're danish. "Rugbrød" means rye-bread, and "arbejde" means work.
The term is essentially about boring routine-work that you know perfectly well how to do.
And if you're in doubt whether to codegenate/automate something then I've found it to be a useful heruristic.
"Is it rugbrødsarbejde?" if yes, then go ahead and generate it. You should be in a good position to review and assess it, and use the time-saving on something more important. Is it not? Well, then you probably benefit from getting your hands dirty. And at some point, that kind of work might just end up being rugbrødsarbejde.


On the other hand, you might find work that used to be rugbrødsarbejde to be foreign to you. And that you might need to get your hands dirty again.

- TODO: add something about simplicity

Don't stop writing. Use your new-found time and efficiency to get into even harder problems than what you're solving today.

# Hard problems

There's a lot to be said about using agents for experimental work. Throwing them at bugs, or iterating on something challenging that you don't find the time to.
I think agents can be great for learning, but it requires discipline. They easily become a crutch that you depend on fully.
If you decide to let an agent loose on non-rugsbrødsarbejde over night, you probably want to understand the solution it came up with, might even want to see if you can recreate it from scratch.
