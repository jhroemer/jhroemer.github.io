- Short summary of talk

https://www.infoq.com/presentations/Simple-Made-Easy/

## Component lifecycle

- Solid one time
- React is very easy to get started with, and to understand. But gets tricky really fast. Strict mode is a testament to this.

## Data fetching

- Missing componentWillMount - today achieving something like this can be done in a myriad of ways; loaders, react query, RSC etc. It's a jungle.
-

## Conditional rendering

- <Show>, <Match>, <For> etc.
- React is easy, but needs linting rules for a lot of stuff, like forgetting keys.
- Of course you could also forget to use the <For> component in solid's jsx, RTFM
