- The issue with frontend's is that you cannot so easily treat things small atomic units that you mix and match. You're creating a user interface, which primary component is visual. That's something else than services that work together through text-based input and output.
- HTML and CSS is supposed to work independently of each other, but in reality they rarely don't. Styling (CSS) _does_ rely on the composition (html) and these days just doesn't ship without each other.
