If the title makes no sense to you then don't worry - it's because you're not into mountain biking, which I am. Actually; if you're into mountain biking it may still make no sense, so let me elaborate. I like analogies, and one of my favorites in the context of design is the speed bump. I also like coming up with analogies, especially if they involve something I'm interested in, which is how we're getting to talk about the speed control berm.

### Speed bump

But first, let's talk about another analogy; the speed bump. I've tried and failed to find the original reference, which I think is from a class in interaction design many years ago. The idea is that when you're designing something and you're trying to protect- or make the user do the right thing in a situation, you can choose to go for a solution similar to a speed limit sign, or you can use a speed bump. The sign is the least effective, since users can just decide to ignore the sign, whereas the speed bump forces the user to slow down, otherwise they will cause damage to their car. You can apply this sort of thinking to digital design. Generally whenever there's a situation where users can do something wrong, use the speed bump since it eliminates wrong usage instead of _trying_ to eliminate wrong usage.

How would this look in digital design? A typical example is some kind of entity deletion exposed to users. Instead of letting them delete something with a simple click of a button, they also need to confirm deletion by entering the name of what they want to delete in an input field. That forces them to stop and think about their action. This is also what's called a [forcing function](https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/book/the-glossary-of-human-computer-interaction/forcing-functions).

There's one obvious issue with the analogy though; which is that few people actually like speed bumps. They're annoying, dangerous and uncomfortable to cross. It's ambiguous and is also used to describe [bad ux](https://articles.ux-primer.com/friction-points-identifying-and-refining-problem-areas-in-user-journeys-e7efbc00f75e).

### Tip

It's hard finding good solutions like this. It's at the core of good design. My best tip is this: if you find that you're doing something that could be seen as a speed limit sign, then you have the chance to take a step back and consider if you can do better.
