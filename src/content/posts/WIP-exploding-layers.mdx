import ExplodingLayers from "../../components/ExplodingLayers.astro";

So I was looking at some of CSS rock star Jhey Tompkins work, when I had a [_Hal fixing a light bulb_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbSehcT19u0&ab_channel=VinnieFarsheds) moment; I was trying to implement and configure his glowing cards, when I realized how much is going on in that demo. Then I looked for a simpler version of it, found none, and got the idea that I could make one myself. And why not use the ‘exploding layers’ technique to break down the layers and pseudo-elements, like he does in his full demo? So here we are, exploding/3D layers with CSS.

That’s the good thing about writing your own blog — you don’t have to fix the light bulb if you’d rather fix the car instead.
