    Hi, I'm Jens, a Software Developer specializing in frontend development. At
    the moment, I'm working on developer tooling at <a href="https://unity.com/"
      >Unity Technologies</a
    >.
  </p>

  <p>
    I'm a product-driven developer, who've ended up as a bit of an octupus,
    because I've had the chance to do things I like. I love getting new projects
    in the air, and to work closely- and iteratively together with users.
  </p>

  <p>
    I read a lot, and I've begun writing again on my <a href="/blog">blog</a>,
    which is a great way of learning and having access to thoughts of the past.
    Speaking of the past; you can have a look at my work
    <a href="/about"> here</a>.
  </p>
</BaseLayout>
