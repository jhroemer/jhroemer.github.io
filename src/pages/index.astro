    Hi, my name is Jens, I'm a Software Developer mainly in React-based frontend
    development. I'm currently working developer tooling in <a
      href="https://unity.com/">Unity Technologies</a
    >.
  </p>

  <p>
    I'm a product-driven developer, who've ended up as a bit of an octupus,
    because I've had the chance to do things I like. I love getting new projects
    in the air, and to work closely- and iteratively together with users. Graph
    theory is my favorite computer science theme, and CSS has slowly become my
    guilty-pleasure.
  </p>

  <p>
    Reading and writing is one of the ways I thrive in life. If there's
    something I'd love to get better at, I better be writing about it in my
    blog. If I'm looking to escape a bit, I'll pick up a book and go to that
    other place.
  </p>

  <p>
    I read a lot, and I've begun writing again on my <a href="/blog">blog</a>,
    which is a great way of learning and having access to thoughts of the past.
    Speaking of the past; you can have a look at my work
    <a href="/about"> here</a>.
  </p>
</BaseLayout>
